# one-click-deploy

## Introduction

This is a tool meant to help FRC teams easily download their C++ code from their repository, 
compile it, and deploy it to the robot. This tool is meant to assist those who don't know
much about using WindRiver/mucking around with IP Addresses.

Warning: This is in a very pre-Alpha stage, and hasn't been tested yet. You will also need to
run the Python file as an administrator if you want it to be able to switch the IP addresses.
